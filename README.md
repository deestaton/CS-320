# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by taking advantage of unit testing techniques after I write each component. This way I do not have to wait until I reach the testing phase of the SDLC where it's much more likely that there will be a high number of bugs, defects, or errors. Not only does testing my code as I write it reduce the number of bugs, it is much less costly to fix them later on.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

My approach to interpreting user needs is by reviewing the requirements and breaking them down into individual action items. From that point, I create and write JUnit test cases based on the user's requirements. Staying in constant communication with the user and/or their stakeholders is highly important too. I can go to them when I have questions, or concerns and they can come to me when, or if, their requirements change.

# How do I approach designing software?

Software design involves conceptualizing a user's requirements into software implementation. My approach to designing software begins when I have a clear understanding of the user's requirements. From this point I separate the functional and non-functional requirements, and create test cases for each of the components. If I have any error and/or failures with the test cases, I will go back into the code base for refactoring, and repeat the process again.
